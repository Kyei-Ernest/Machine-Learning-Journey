Overview of Files
__init__.py: This file initializes the Voting_system package.
age_calc.py: Contains functionality to calculate age based on a given date of birth.
ballot_creation.py: Handles the creation of ballots for the voting system.
mysql_delete.py: Provides functionality to delete records from a MySQL database.
mysql_value_checker.py: Checks values in a MySQL database.
prov_Ghcard_details.py: Handles provisional Ghana card details (possibly for voter identification).
Registration.py: Manages voter registration processes.
results_processing.py: Processes and tabulates voting results.
schema.py: Defines the database(MySQL) schema for the voting system.
voting.py: Contains the main logic for the voting process.

NB:All these files are connected to a MYsql database(Which means you will need a MYsql database to run these files successsfully).
   First of all make sure to setup your your database(MYsql) and run the schema.py file in order to create the database needed for the voting system.
# Steps
* Run schema.py to create the database structure required for the voting system( note that the database name you use
  must be used across all the other modules) 
* Execute the "start_other_registration()" function [register the presidential_candidate,the constituencies and the member_of_parliament(take note of the 
  order stated and do same)]. After you can execute the "start_voter_registration()" function to register voters.
* User can then cast votes using the voting module

    - **Parameters**: 
      - 'db_config (dic)': configuration for the database. 
      - `table (str)`: Name of the table from which the column is to be deleted.
      - `column (str)`: name of column to be deleted.
    - **Description**: 
      - Connects to the MySQL database, executes the delete command based on the tabel and column to be, and commits the transaction.
- **Function**:
    - `delete_row(db_config, table, condition)`:
       - **Parameters**: 
         - 'db_config (dic)': configuration for the database. 
         - `table (str)`: Name of the table from which records are to be deleted.
         - `condition (str)`: SQL condition to specify which records to delete.
       - **Description**: 
         - Connects to the MySQL database, executes the delete command based on the condition, and commits the transaction.


### `mysql_value_checker.py`
Checks if specific values exist within a MySQL database table.

- **Function**:
  - `check_value_exists(db_config, table, column, user_input)`:
    - **Parameters**: 
      - 'db_config (dic)': configuration for the database.

    - **Returns**: 
      - `bool`: True if the value exists, False otherwise.
    - **Description**: 
      - Connects to the MySQL database and performs a query to check if the specified value exists in the given column.

### `prov_Ghcard_details.py`
Handles provisional Ghana card details, which may be used for voter identification and verification. This is a way to help test or use the program since i donnot 
have access to the Ghana Card details database. You can feel free to make a lot of changes to the data or the module in general just to make it more realistic unless 
you have access to the original database.

### `Registration.py`
Manages the voter registration process, ensuring that all necessary details are collected and stored.

- **Function**:
  - `register_voter(voter_details)`:
    - **Parameters**: 
      - `voter_details (dict)`: Dictionary containing voter details such as name, date of birth, and address.
    - **Returns**: 
      - `bool`: True if registration is successful, False otherwise.
    - **Description**: 
      - Processes the provided voter details and registers the voter, typically by storing the information in a database.

    - **Parameters**: 
      - `ballots (list)`: List of ballots where each ballot is a dictionary with candidate names as keys and vote counts as values.
